[1] Obtain trading histories of successful trades and use those to improve / initialize your trading bots. 

There is no public dataset that provides full private trading histories of discretionary Ethereum traders. Centralised exchanges do not expose individual user trade logs, and anyone claiming to sell complete “top trader” datasets is fabricating or heavily cherry-picking data. However, there are legitimate and widely used alternatives that allow you to study real, successful Ethereum trading behaviour.
The most reliable source of real trading behaviour is on-chain wallet data. Because Ethereum is fully transparent, it is possible to reconstruct complete trading histories for profitable wallets directly from the blockchain. Tools such as Etherscan provide raw transaction logs, while platforms like DeBank summarise DeFi positions and historical activity. Advanced analytics platforms such as Nansen label wallets associated with consistently profitable or “smart money” behaviour, and Dune allows you to query Ethereum data directly using SQL. From these sources, you can reconstruct timestamps, entry and exit prices for decentralised exchange trades, position sizes, and behavioural characteristics such as holding periods and timing patterns, though this requires non-trivial reconstruction work.
Another indirect source of information is copy-trading platforms, which expose curated trade feeds and performance metrics for selected traders. Platforms such as eToro, Binance Copy Trading, Bybit, and Bitget provide visibility into trader behaviour and decision patterns. However, these feeds are often delayed, filtered, and constrained by platform risk controls, and they suffer heavily from survivorship bias. As a result, they are useful for understanding human trading behaviour but are unreliable for extracting raw execution-level alpha.
Some insight can also be gained from crypto fund disclosures. A small number of asset managers, such as ARK Invest and Pantera Capital, publish periodic updates on holdings or performance. These disclosures are typically monthly or quarterly and represent position snapshots rather than detailed trade histories, making them unsuitable for short-horizon or execution-level analysis.
For research and modelling purposes, many practitioners rely on academic and market data providers rather than individual trader histories. Providers such as Kaiko and CryptoCompare offer high-quality market data used to study strategy structures and statistical properties of crypto markets. These datasets support backtesting and feature engineering but do not represent the behaviour of specific traders.
In practice, the standard approach used in quantitative crypto research is to identify statistically profitable Ethereum wallets on-chain, reconstruct their decentralised exchange trades, extract behavioural features such as entry timing, position sizing, and holding duration, and then learn generalisable rules and distributions rather than attempting to copy individual signals. This methodology underpins most serious on-chain analytics, systematic trading research, and reinforcement learning-based crypto trading systems.
